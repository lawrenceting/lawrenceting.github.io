Since there’s no way to turn app nap off universally, I’ve created a script that turns on/off app nap for applications in the Applications folder (including apps in subfolders).

**How To Use**

1. System requirements: `OSX Mavericks`

1. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c1xfepbdz1fdqaw/Turn%20ON%20%7C%20OFF%20App%20Nap.workflow.zip" target="_blank">Download</a> the zip file and extract it.

2. Double click the Automator workflow > click “Install” > click “Done”.

4. Run the service from Finder.

5. Alternatively, you can just open the workflow in Automator and run it from there.
