*Step 1*

Reopen QuickTime Player. Your recording might still be avilable as an unsaved file. If step 1 fails, go to step 2. 

*Step 2*

1. Go to `/Users/UserName/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave Information`
2. Replace "UserName" with your own
3. You should be able to see a file named `Unsaved QuickTime Player Document.qtpxcomposition` > Right Click > Show Package Contents
4. The unsaved recording will be named `Audio Recording.m4a`
