title: Chinese Word of the Day - Geeklet
---

I'm currently relearning the Chinese language. Most of the "word of the day" geeklets are in English. I decided to create a Chinsese word of the day geeklet. The chinese words are translated into English. There are 6 levels to choose from, 1 = easy, 6 = hard. You may modify the geeklet to suit your needs.
